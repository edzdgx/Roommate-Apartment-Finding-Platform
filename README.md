# 202112-25-Roommate-Apartment-Finding-Platform
EECS E6893 Big Data Analytics final project

## Introduction
The number of international students in the United States is increasing these years. It is a little hard for new international students to find roommates and apartments which fit their needs. So, this project is going to build a roommates and apartments platform for new students. We designed our own frontend website and will use cluster algorithm like euclidean distance, cosine similarity and K-Means to get our recommendation, the result will show on the frontend back. Besides, we will compare algorithm we used to find which one is better for our platform.
